üöÄ Project Overview # BurialDB is a web-based Cemetery Management System built to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of cemetery services. Traditional cemetery operations often suffer from manual processes, which can result in delayed transactions, mismanaged records, and lack of client visibility. BurialDB addresses these issues by offering a user-friendly digital solution for both clients and administrators.
Clients can register, log in, and interact with their data through a personalized dashboard.</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://smmin21.github.io/posts/burial_db/featured.webp"/></item><item><title>Space Ablaze: 2D Survival Shooter Game written in C++ using RayLib Library</title><link>https://smmin21.github.io/posts/space_ablaze/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://smmin21.github.io/posts/space_ablaze/</guid><description>‚ú® Did you know? # This game was GameJam Plus | Asia &amp;amp; Ocenia Region: SEMI FINALISTüèÜ
