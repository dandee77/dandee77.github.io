I'm a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at **Bulacan State University**, currently deep in my training arc — transitioning from C++ game development into full-stack web and mobile development.

I've always been passionate about building amazing things with code. With a strong foundation in programming — including **OOP**, **manual memory management**, and **data structures & algorithms** — I'm now expanding into **web technologies**, **mobile apps**, and **AI-powered systems**.

This site is where I document my journey:

- ✅ **Projects** — what I built, how I built it, and what I learned
- 🧠 **Insights** — lessons, tech breakdowns, and workflow optimizations
- 🏆 **Milestones** — key wins and progress as I level up

I'm all about learning fast, solving real problems, and constantly pushing my technical boundaries. Thanks for stopping by — let’s build something awesome. 🚀
