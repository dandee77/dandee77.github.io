## üöÄ Project Overview

**BurialDB** is a web-based Cemetery Management System built to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of cemetery services. Traditional cemetery operations often suffer from manual processes, which can result in delayed transactions, mismanaged records, and lack of client visibility. BurialDB addresses these issues by offering a user-friendly digital solution for both clients and administrators.

Clients can register, log in, and interact with their data through a personalized dashboard. Key features include plot browsing via an interactive vicinity map, real-time payment tracking, contract overview, and the ability to purchase slots or mausoleums directly from the interface. Administrators benefit from robust tools to monitor statistics, manage client information, oversee all contracts, and track overall revenue.

## üß© System Architecture Overview

![System Screenshot](assets/landing.png)
> Figure 1: Landing Page Flowchart

MemorialDB, we 
followed a practical and straightforward 
development process using a mix of front-end 
and back-end technologies. We designed the 
user interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
to make sure the website looked clean, was easy 
to navigate, and worked well on different 
devices. 
On the back-end, we used Python with 
FastAPI to handle the logic behind the scenes. 
FastAPI allowed us to create a fast and secure 
connection between the website and the 
database. For storing data like burial records and 
plot information, we chose SQLite‚Äîa simple, 
lightweight database that was easy to set up and 
worked well for our project‚Äôs needs. 
To make the system accessible online 
while we were developing and testing it, we 
used Ngrok. This tool gave us a public URL that 
linked to our local server, making it easy to test 
the website from different devices or share it 
with others for feedback.

The system follows a **client-server model** using FastAPI for backend logic and RESTful APIs for communication. The database schema includes models for clients, slots, deceased individuals, contracts, and payments. Authentication is temporarily managed with session variables and will transition to JWT for improved security in the future.

User actions on the frontend (e.g., buying a slot or viewing payments) send requests to the API, which processes the logic and interacts with the SQLite database. Responses are then rendered back into the UI dynamically.
