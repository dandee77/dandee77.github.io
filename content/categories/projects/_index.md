🛠️ Explore My Work

Welcome to the Projects page — a curated collection of the things I’ve built, broken, and rebuilt. From full-stack web apps and AI experiments to game development and tooling, each project reflects hands-on problem solving and a drive to push technical boundaries.

Dive into individual write-ups to see design decisions, architecture breakdowns, challenges faced, and the impact of each build. This is where ideas turn into real, working code. 🔧🚀
